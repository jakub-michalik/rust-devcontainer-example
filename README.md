### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Open the Command Palette in Codespaces:**
   - In your Codespace (VS Code in the browser), press `F1` or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Cmd+Shift+P on Mac).
   - Type **"dev"** in the search bar.  
   - **Select:** *"Codespaces: Add Dev Container Configuration Files..."*  
     *(As shown in the image you posted where "Codespaces: Add Dev Container Configuration Files..." appears in the command palette.)*

2. **Choose the Dev Container Template:**
   - A dialog will appear asking you to pick a template for your dev container.
   - Type or scroll to **"Rust"** and select the Rust dev container template.  
     *(As shown in your next image, you typed "rust" and selected the Rust template.)*

3. **Select the Debian OS Version:**
   - Next, you’ll see a prompt to select a Debian OS version (e.g. `bullseye` by default).
   - If you want to change it, choose the version from the dropdown. Otherwise, keep the default.
   - Press **Enter** or **OK** to confirm.  
     *(This corresponds to the image where you selected `bullseye`.)*

4. **Choose Additional Features:**
   - Another dialog might appear asking if you’d like to add additional features or tools. For example, extra utilities or language servers.
   - If you don’t need any extras, simply proceed without selecting anything.  
     *(This corresponds to the image showing "0 Selected" for additional features.)*
   - Press **OK** to continue.

5. **Confirm and Generate the Files:**
   - After selecting the OS version and any features, press **OK**.
   - Codespaces will now generate a `.devcontainer` folder in your project with a `devcontainer.json` file (and possibly a `Dockerfile`) tailored to Rust development.  
     *(This step corresponds to when you said "I've hit OK" in your instructions.)*

6. **Rebuild the Container:**
   - Once the files are generated, you’ll see a prompt or can open the Command Palette again.
   - Type **"rebuild"** and select *"Codespaces: Rebuild Container"*.
   - This will shut down the current container environment and rebuild it according to the new configuration.  
     *(As shown in your screenshot where you typed “rebu” and selected “Codespaces: Rebuild Container”.)*

7. **Wait for the Container to Finish Building:**
   - Codespaces will run through the Dockerfile and `devcontainer.json` steps, setting up the environment. This includes installing Rust, Cargo, and other specified tools.
   - Once done, you’ll have a fully configured Rust development environment inside your Codespace.

8. **Verify Rust and Cargo:**
   - Open a terminal in your Codespace (`Terminal > New Terminal`).
   - Run:
     ```bash
     rustc --version
     cargo --version
     ```
   - You should see Rust and Cargo version information, confirming the tools are successfully installed.
